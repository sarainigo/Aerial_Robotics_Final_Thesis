# Aerial_Robotics_Final_Thesis
Development and integration of a quadricopter swarm test bench with the support of the Optitrack motion capture system, so that it can be used easily and efficiently by a user. This user will be able to control the swarm by sending positions, commanding speeds or sending trajectories to be followed using topics, services and ROS actions, being able to test its high level algorithms. 

The quadricopter model that has been selected for the integration into the test bench is the Parrot Airborne Cargo Travis. 

This project has been based on a library already developed for the connection and sending of basic commands. This library has been integrated into ROS to facilitate the development of the control package.
